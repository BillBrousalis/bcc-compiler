# BCC - Bad C Compiler

Work in progress

```
TODO:

next up - assembly generation

registers
--
useful structure to use in the asm_gen phase

labels
--
generate labels for every point we will be jumping to in the source code

keep track of general purpose registers - their names, and if they are in use.
pick the first not in use register to use


Parsing
--
implement conditionals, loops etc

Lexing
--
eventually implement more keywords to detect, but get basic asm generation working first

```
